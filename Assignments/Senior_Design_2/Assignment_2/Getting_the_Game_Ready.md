# __Getting the Game Ready__
___

* Download/Clone [Attack of the Beat](https://github.com/WrathOfRa/AotB)  
![](/Assignments/Senior_Design_2/Assignment_2/Images/1_Extract.jpg "Extract Master Zip")

* Move the Attack_of_the_Beat subfolder, which contains the game files, to a preferred folder location.  
![](/Assignments/Senior_Design_2/Assignment_2/Images/2_Desired_Location.jpg "Move Attack_of_the_Beat to Desired Location")

* Our recommendation is to keep everything under the Attack_of_the_Beat folder, which will then have two versions:
  * Built - this version can be played from a single executable
  * Developer - this version allows you to edit game files, but requires the Unity Editor and you must build the game in order to play

* For more details on starting either version, see [Starting the Game.](https://github.com/WrathOfRa/AotB/tree/master/Assignments/Senior_Design_2/Assignment_2/Starting_the_Game.md)
