# __Frequently Asked Questions__
___

### __Your questions, our answers.__

__1. What music files can be used in this game?__
  * So far, .mp3 and .wav have been tested and work
  * .m4a has been confirmed to not work (limitation by Unity)

__2. What music genres are usable?__
  * Any music will work, but certain genres and songs will perform better than others.
  * Any song that results in a wide, somewhat evenly spread frequency chart and does not have impactful changes may not perform well.
  * Also, songs that are constantly noisy may not result as well as others.
  * It is important to try different genres and songs to see what works best for your style, and more improvements will come in the future.

__3. Are the songs analyzed prior to being played in game?__
  * No, each "part" of the song you hear is analyzed at the time it is being prepared to play in the game.

__4. Why do I have to use the Developer Version to use my own music?__
  * The current way that music resources are accessed in Unity are through the project's resource folder.
  * When the game is built, those resources are modified to a custom Unity file where nothing can be easily added after the build.
  * It was researched to use Asset Bundles in order remove the need to use the Developer Version, but, due to time constraints, this was not implemented.
  * This however has become one of our top future goals so that our users can have a more seemless custom experience.

__5. Do you have plans for expanding the types of attacks made from the music?__
  * Yes, one of which are dynamic projectiles or bullets that get fired based on the music.
  * This was already experimented with, but I could not get it into a state that I though was good enough to publish, so it was put aside for now.
  * Along with the ease of adding music, this is the other future goal that I want to pursue when time is available.
  * This is not the only type/path that would be possible to make.  
    * I want to also pursue enemy movement controlled by music as well, and there are many more options that I want to explore
