# __Frequently Asked Questions__

Your questions, our answers.

1. What music files can be used in this game?
  * So far, .mp3 and .wav have been tested and work
  * .m4a has been confirmed to not work (limitation by Unity)

2. What music genres are usable?
  * Any music will work, but certain genres and songs will perform better than others.
  * Any song that results in a wide, somewhat evenly spread frequency chart and does not have impactful changes may not perform well.
  * Also, songs that are constantly noisy may not result as well as others.
  * It is important to try different genres and songs to see what works best for your style, and more improvements will come in the future.

3. Are the songs analyzed prior to being played in game?
  * No, each "part" of the song you hear is analyzed at the time it is being prepared to play in the game.

4. Why do I have to use the Developer Version to use my own music?
  * The current way that music resources are accessed in Unity are through the project's resource folder.
  * When the game is built, those resources are modified to a custom Unity file where nothing can be easily added after the build.
  * It was researched to use Asset Bundles in order remove the need to use the Developer Version, but, due to time constraints, this was not implemented.
  * This however has become one of our top future goals so that our users can have a more seemless custom experience.

5. Do you have plans for expanding the types of attacks made from the music?
  * Yes, one of which are dynamic projectiles or bullets that get fired based on the music.
  * This was already experimented with, but I could not get it into a state that I though was good enough to publish, so it was put aside for now.
  * Along with the ease of adding music, this is the other future goal that I want to pursue when time is available.
  * This is not the only type/path that would be possible to make.  
    * I want to also pursue enemy movement controlled by music as well, and there are many more options that I want to explore
